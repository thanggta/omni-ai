## Implementation Tasks (Sequential Order)

**FOCUS: First 3 Core Features Only**
1. Twitter Sentiment & Trend Analysis
2. SUI Token Market Intelligence
3. AI Chat Interface for insights

**UI Approach: Simple chatbox interface only - no navigation, headers, or complex layouts**

### Phase 7: Integration & Polish
- #TODO-31: Connect all components and test data flow
- #TODO-32: Implement responsive design and mobile optimization
- #TODO-33: Add loading states and error boundaries
- #TODO-34: Create user preferences and settings
- #TODO-35: Final testing and bug fixes

## File Creation Order (SIMPLIFIED)
1. Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
2. Type definitions (simplified)
3. Jotai store atoms (chat-focused)
4. API service layers (3 core features only)
5. Simple chat interface component
6. API endpoints (chat, twitter, market)
7. Integration and testing

## DEFERRED (implement after core features work):
- Alert system UI components
- Token display UI components
- Complex layouts and navigation
- Swap interface
- Portfolio tracking UI

## Key Dependencies to Install
- Next.js 14, TypeScript, React
- shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- Jotai for state management
- SUI SDK for blockchain integration
- OpenAI SDK, LangChain
- Various API clients (Twitter, CoinGecko)

## Notes
- Focus on core chatbot functionality first
- Text-only interaction for simplicity
- No testing/security/auditing for hackathon speed
- Use TODO comments to track progress
